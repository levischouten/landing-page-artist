        Ivo Schouten’s artwork is characterized by his clear composition, sleek
        lines, and modular components that the artist brings to life in his two-
        and three-dimensional pieces.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Each work arises from the artist’s clear ideas about form and color
        without being dogmatic. The contrasts within the work – rigid and
        angular versus open and flexible – are designed to guide the observer to
        develop their own interpretation.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        Many of the materials used in the works are not traditionally designed
        to serve as a canvas. Working with ventilation grilles, ceiling and wall
        panels stimulates Ivo’s creativity and requires an open mind. Behind the
        clean lines lies an attitude to life that is definitely not rigid.
